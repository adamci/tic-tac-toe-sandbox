Tic Tac Toe Sandbox
===================

The following is an ongoing project to get some initial exposure to game
playing systems. The goal is to build an object oriented tic tac toe
platform that can allow four kinds of players to compete against one
another:
* Human player
* Random player
* Minimax player (with adjustable depth)
* Reinforcement learning player

In addition to being a first foray into reinforcement learning, this
project also aims to serve as empirical proof that the quality of
reinforcement learning is a function of the quality of the teacher.
